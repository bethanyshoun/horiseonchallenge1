# Refactor Starter Code for Accessibility

## Project Description
The purpose of this project was to refactor starter code to make the code more accessible to people using assistive technology. I created alt tags for exisiting images to make them accessible to screen readers. I also did research about making the hero accessible and added a title to the "hero" section to make that background image accessible to a screen reader. I rearranged and consolidated CSS selectors and properties so the stylesheet follows HTML structure. I added comments to the style sheet for improved readability. I updated the HTML to better align it with semantic conventions, added comments, and removed exraneous code like the "/" present at the end of each img element before the closing tag ">". I tested the updates using the screen reader built into my MAC OS. This project tested my knowledge of introductory code and repositories from start to finish.
